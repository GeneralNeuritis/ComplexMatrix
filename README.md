  so more programming languages like c++, but not c++.
  i got my template layering to work and i'm confident
  in my memory management routines.  i hope that the 
  code doesn't hide anything.

  perhaps later versions of c++ got too top heavy with 
  lambdas because everyone was thirsty for new syntax.
  the syntax is there if we need it.

  the fireworks for the templates is at the bottom of 
  "engine.cpp" and that where this implementation 
  starts.  i wanted this matrix implementation to have 
  the same feel as code written for embedded systems.
