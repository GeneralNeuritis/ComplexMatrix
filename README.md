  so more programming languages like c++, but not c++.
  i got my template layering to work and i'm confident
  in my memory management routines.  i hope that the 
  code doesn't hide anything.

  perhaps later versions of c++ got too top heavy with 
  lambdas because everyone was thirsty for new syntax.
  the syntax is there if we need it.

  the fireworks for the templates is at the bottom of 
  "engine.cpp" and that where this implementation 
  starts.  i wanted this matrix implementation to have 
  the same feel as code written for embedded systems
  because it might be easier to port.

  i could go smaller if i used void pointers and that
  is the option i'm exploring for stacking into an 
  array_t and allocating each as a matrix_t.

  look for the equivalent of fixed gaps for matrices
  to not go to waste.
